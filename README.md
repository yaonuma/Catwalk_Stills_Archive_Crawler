# Fashion_Runway_Show_Archive
A webscraped archive of catwalk images using Beautiful Soup and Selenium.


Abstract:

There is no data in the repository. You must configure your environment, then run main.py. It will generate a "data" folder containing M thumbnail images (106x160 pixels, jpeg format) from thousands of designers (not commercially oriented companies for mass consumers), for women and men, from 1995 to 2020. This dataset is intended to be used in conjunction with a pretrained/modified convolutional neural network that can take a new catwalk image, perform segmentation to separate the clothing from the model, then run it against this database, which is also to be segmented in the same way, and return an "originality index", which is yet to be mathematically defined, and a list of the top correlating images (designs) from the archives. Since fashion trends are rarely totally new, but often cyclical over decades, there should, in principle, exist past images/designs which a human would agree are highly correlated. The end product would ideally be an AI manifestation of Diet Prada (https://www.dietprada.com/). Not as powerful as the two humans that run it, but still useful.
